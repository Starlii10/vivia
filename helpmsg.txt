# Heya!
My name's Vivia, and it's a pleasure to meet you!
My command prefix is usually `v!`. Put that in front of any message to direct it to me. I'll make sure I notice!
Alternatively, some of my functions can be activated through the application menu. I'll ALWAYS notice those!
## Commands
These are some of the things that I am capable of doing for you. Just ask!
### help
*Usage: `v!help` or application menu command.*
Sends this message you're reading right now!
### quote
*Usage: `v!quote` or application menu command.*
Sends a random (slightly chaotic) quote.
### sync
*Usage: `v!sync`*
Syncs the command tree (which is just a nerdy way of saying it updates what commands are available in the application menu).
### say
*Usage: `v!say {message}` or application menu command*
Make me say anything you want! But only for the bot owner.
### addquote
*Usage: `v!addquote {quote} {author} {date}` or application menu command*
Adds a quote that I can say with the quote command!
## GitHub
My code is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/starlii10/vivia/)! If you want to, you can even run your own version of me!
