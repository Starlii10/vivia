# Heya!
My name's Vivia, and it's a pleasure to meet you!
My command prefix is `v!`. Put that in front of any message to direct it to me. I'll make sure I notice!
Alternatively, some of my functions can be activated through the application menu. I'll ALWAYS notice those!
## Commands
These are some of the things that I am capable of doing for you. 
### help
*Usage: `v!help` or application menu command.*
Sends this message you're reading right now!
### quote
*Usage: `v!quote` or application menu command.*
Sends a random (slightly chaotic) quote.
## GitHub
My code is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/starlii10/vivia/)! If you want to, you can even run your own version of me!
