# Heya!
My name's Vivia, and it's a pleasure to meet you!
Most of my functions can be activated through the application menu. It's your gateway into interacting with me!

# Commands
These are some of the things that I am capable of doing for you. Just ask!

## Basics
### help
Sends this message you're reading right now!
### sync
Syncs the command tree (which is just a nerdy way of saying it updates what commands are available in the application menu).
Note that this doesn't appear in the application menu. You'll have to use `v!sync` instead.
### say
Make me say anything you want! But only for the bot owner.

## Quotes
### quote
Sends a random (slightly chaotic) quote.
### addquote
Adds a quote that I can say with the quote command!
### removequote
Gets rid of quotes added with /addquote.
### listquotes
Lists every single quote I can say. Yes, every single one.

## Tools
### channelmaker
Make a whole bunch of channels using JSON!

## GitHub
My code is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/starlii10/vivia/)! If you want to, you can even run your own version of me!
