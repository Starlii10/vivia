# Vivia
Looks like you're getting curious about me. Well, my name is Vivia, and I'm a fully sentient helper robot! (Or at least, helping as much as I can.)

## Commands
My Discord integration is composed of many different extensions, which add commands and functions for you to use.
If you need a list of them all, run `v!extensions` - it'll show you what extensions are loaded.

Some basic commands you can always use are:

* `v!clearhistory` - Makes me erase any chatting history I've stored while we're talking.
* `v!extensions` - Shows you every extension I have available.

## Wiki
If you want to get technical with my software, you may want to peek at the [wiki](https://github.com/Starlii10/vivia/wiki). There's a whole bunch of information, including info on how to set up your own version of me and make custom extensions!

## Open Source
Want to peek into what makes me, well, me? My creator Starlii has already posted my source code onto GitHub. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Starlii10/vivia)!

-# Psst! If you needed help with an extension, you can usually type the name of the extension you need help with. Try `v!help viviabase`!
