# Channel Maker
The channelmaker tool is a helpful tool to create a bunch of channels from JSON.

# How to Use
A channelmaker JSON configuration looks like this:
```json
{
    "categories": {
        "category1": [
            "channel1"
        ]
    }
}
```
- "categories" is where you put in your categories. You can define as many categories as you want!
- In the example above, we have one category called "category1" and a channel inside called "channel1".

You can also define the type of channels you want to create with the `type` argument.
- "text" makes text channels.
- "voice" makes voice channels.
- "forum" makes forum channels, but only in servers where it's supported (non-community servers usually can't make forum channels).
