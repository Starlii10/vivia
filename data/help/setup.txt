# Setting Up Vivia
Vivia requires a little bit of configuration to work optimally.

## The "Vivia Admin" Role
Users with this role are able to use commands such as /channelmaker, as well as editing the configuration.
Only give this role to people you trust! Vivia will automatically assign this role to users with Administrator permissions.

## Settings
