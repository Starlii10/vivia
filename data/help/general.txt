# Heya!
My name's Vivia, and it's a pleasure to meet you!
Most of my functions can be activated through the application menu. It's your gateway into interacting with me!

# Commands
These are some of the things that I am capable of doing for you. Just ask!

## Basics
### help
Sends this message you're reading right now! (Among other helpful things, of course.)

## Quotes
### quote
Sends a random (slightly chaotic) quote.
### addquote
Adds a quote that I can say with the quote command!
### removequote
Gets rid of quotes added with /addquote.
### listquotes
Lists every single quote I can say. Yes, every single one.

## Tools
### channelmaker
Make a whole bunch of channels using JSON! Use /channelmaker help for extra guidance.
### namegenerator
Generate a random name!

# Chatting
Pinging me lets me engage in conversation! It's a weird feature and highly unstable, though...
I heard it was powered by something called LLaMa? I'm not too familiar with that.

## GitHub
My code is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/starlii10/vivia/)! If you want to, you can even run your own version of me!
