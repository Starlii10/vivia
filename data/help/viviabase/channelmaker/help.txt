# ViviaBase: `channelmaker`
The channelmaker command is a helpful tool to create a bunch of channels from a JSON file.

## Command
Usage: `v!channelmaker <JSON> <channel type>`
Examples:
* `v!channelmaker {"categories":{"Text Channels":["general","bot-commands","memes","art"]}}`
* `v!channelmaker {"categories":{"Voice Channels":["General","Streaming","Games 1","Games 2"]}} voice`
* `v!channelmaker {"categories":{"Forums":["starliis-art","character-profiles","vivia-bug-reports"]}} forum`
**Requires Vivia Admin**

## JSON Format
A channelmaker JSON configuration looks like this:
```json
{
    "categories": {
        "category1": [
            "channel1"
        ]
    }
}
```
- "categories" is where you put in your categories. You can define as many categories as you want!
- In the example above, we have one category called "category1" and a channel inside called "channel1".

## Channel Type
You can also define the type of channels you want to create with the `type` argument.
- "text" makes text channels.
- "voice" makes voice channels.
- "forum" makes forum channels, but only in servers where it's supported (non-community servers usually can't make forum channels).

-# Why spend 5 minutes manually making channels when you can just spend 30 minutes automating it?
